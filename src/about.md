Hey! I am Jess Beale and I have recently finished a course in Architectural Technology at Weltec. I have had a number of roles working in technology with different types of software; learning new tools and processes comes naturally to me.

Early in my career I had success becoming an application expert, somebody who got their own work done to a high standard and who others would come to for support. I naturally fell into this role during my time studying Architectural Technology at WelTec, helping others to learn tools like Archicad and Revit. I expect to continue my career doing the same with my peers in building design.

I am ready to build on the broad project management and excellent technology skills I have acquired through my career, combined with the technical drawing and building design skills I have recently picked up. I hope to combine these skills to create technical drawings to a high standard and support a team to design great spaces for people to inhabit.
