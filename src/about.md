Hey! I am Jess Beale and I have recently finished a course in Architectural Technology. I have had a number of roles working in technology with different types of software; learning new tools and processes comes naturally to me. 

Early in my career I had huge success becoming an application expert, somebody who got their own work done to an extremely high standard and who others would come to for support. I naturally fell into this role during my time studying Architectural Technology at WelTec, helping others to learn tools like Archicad and Revit. I expect to continue my career doing the same with my peers in building design.

I am ready to build on the broad project management and excellent technology skills I have acquired through my career combined with the technical drawing and building design skills I have recently picked up to create technical drawings and support a team to design great spaces for people to inhabit.
