world in the 1960's and 70's. Using new technology and advanced manufacturing that would have made them near impossible to realise just a few years ago - GB Masonry and designer Adam Goodrum have created a unique, bold and forward-thinking design that's as original as it is functional.\r\n\r\nWith its combination of geometric design and liveable functionality, every aspect of Kite has been carefully considered.\r\n\r\nAvailable in three iconic colours - Kite offers two distinctive finishes.

world in the 1960's and 70's. Using new technology and advanced manufacturing that would have made them near impossible to realise just a few years ago - GB Masonry and designer Adam Goodrum have created a unique, bold and forward-thinking design that's as original as it is functional.\r\n\r\nWith its combination of geometric design and liveable functionality, every aspect of Kite has been carefully considered.\r\n\r\nAvailable in three iconic colours - Kite offers two distinctive finishes.
