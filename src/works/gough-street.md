Gough Street Workshop was an exercise in accurately modelling a steel framed building using Revit.

The interior spaces were designed to the following brief:

 - Stairs and a lift to a mezzanine floor.

The site was designed to have:
 - Car parking, including at least one accessible park.
 - Safe paths for pedestrians and cyclists.
 - Heavy truck access to the workshop truck door.

The site is at 6 Gough Street in Seaview.
